# Stack Gotchas

Runtime behaviors that bite when running a language/framework stack inside an scdev container.
These apply to **any** scdev project — scaffolded from a template or added to an existing repo.
For template-authoring patterns (`.setup-complete`, scaffolding, `setup.just`), see `templates.md`.

## Node.js / pnpm

- Set `COREPACK_ENABLE_DOWNLOAD_PROMPT: "0"` in config.yaml environment (not in each command).
  Without it, `corepack enable` prompts interactively in the no-TTY entrypoint and hangs.
- `pnpm approve-builds --all` after install to approve native module prebuilt binaries. pnpm v10
  blocks build scripts by default — without approval, native modules (`better-sqlite3`, `esbuild`,
  `@parcel/watcher`) silently fail to install their prebuilt binaries.
- `HOST: "0.0.0.0"` in environment so dev server is accessible from outside the container.
  Otherwise Traefik gets connection-refused — the dev server only bound to loopback.
- Add to mutagen ignore: `node_modules`, `.pnpm-store`, `.scdev`, `.setup-complete`.
  `.pnpm-store` especially — it's a ~500 MB content-addressable store with platform-specific native
  binaries. Syncing it breaks the container when the image changes (glibc vs musl mismatch).
- Framework build artifacts to ignore: `.nuxt`, `.output` (Nuxt), `.next` (Next.js).
- File watching: Node 22+ has `node --watch`; frameworks have their own HMR.

## PHP / Composer

- `php:8.3-cli-alpine` doesn't include Composer or Symfony CLI — install at runtime in the
  entrypoint (guard with `command -v` so restarts don't reinstall):
  ```sh
  wget -qO- https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
  wget -q https://get.symfony.com/cli/installer -O - | bash
  cp $HOME/.symfony5/bin/symfony /usr/local/bin/symfony
  ```
- Install tools to `/usr/local/bin` so they're available in subsequent `scdev exec` calls.
- Symfony dev server: `symfony server:start --no-tls --port=8000 --allow-all-ip`.
  `--no-tls` because scdev terminates TLS via Traefik; `--allow-all-ip` binds to `0.0.0.0`.
- Add to mutagen ignore: `vendor`, `var`, `.scdev`, `.setup-complete`.

## PHP frameworks (Symfony / Sylius / Shopware / Laravel / Akeneo) — runtime gotchas

The five landmines below are the most common causes of "container runs, browser shows a wrong
page" on PHP framework projects. Worth applying proactively, not just when debugging.

### 1. `memory_limit=-1`

The PHP CLI default is 128 MB, which OOMs on Symfony's `cache:clear` post-install script, Composer
dependency solving on large projects, and anything that loads the full Symfony container. Drop in
a php.ini fragment:

```sh
printf 'memory_limit=-1\n' > /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/zz-app.ini
```

Guard with `[ ! -f /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/zz-app.ini ]` in the entrypoint so restarts don't
re-create the file.

### 2. `SYMFONY_TRUSTED_PROXIES: private_ranges`

Traefik terminates HTTPS and forwards plain HTTP to the app. Without a trusted-proxy config,
Symfony can't tell the outer request was HTTPS and generates `http://` URLs inside the HTTPS
page — the browser blocks them as mixed content. Symptoms: Web Debug Toolbar stuck on "Loading…",
admin login bounces, asset manifest URLs 404, password-reset emails link to `http://`.

Set this in the app service environment for any Symfony / Sylius / Shopware project:

```yaml
environment:
  SYMFONY_TRUSTED_PROXIES: private_ranges   # Symfony 6.3+ shorthand for RFC1918 + 127.0.0.1
```

Laravel equivalent: `TRUSTED_PROXIES=*` for the TrustProxies middleware. Any framework that builds
absolute URLs behind a reverse proxy needs similar awareness.

### 3. Missing PHP extensions

`php:8.3-cli-alpine` ships a minimal set. Sylius, Shopware, Akeneo and similar need at least
`intl pdo_mysql gd bcmath opcache exif zip`. Install via
[install-php-extensions](https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer):

```sh
wget -qO /usr/local/bin/install-php-extensions \
  https://github.com/mlocati/docker-php-extension-installer/releases/latest/download/install-php-extensions
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/install-php-extensions
install-php-extensions intl pdo_mysql gd bcmath opcache exif zip
```

Guard with `[ ! -f /usr/local/bin/install-php-extensions ]` in the entrypoint to skip reinstall.

### 4. Asset pipelines need Node

Projects with `package.json` + `webpack.config.js` / `vite.config.js` (Sylius 2.x via Webpack
Encore, Shopware 6 admin, custom themes) need Node.js in the app container. Add `apk add --no-cache
nodejs npm`, run `npm install && npm run build` at setup, and include an idempotent rebuild in the
entrypoint:

```sh
if [ -f package.json ] && [ ! -f public/build/shop/manifest.json ]; then
  npm install --no-audit --no-fund && npm run build;
fi
```

The entrypoint check matters because `public/build` typically lives in `mutagen.ignore` (binary +
regenerable), so it's lost on `scdev down && scdev start`. Without the rebuild, the first page
load 500s on a missing `manifest.json`.

### 5. Mail to Mailpit

```yaml
environment:
  MAILER_DSN: "smtp://mail:1025"     # Symfony/Sylius
  # MAIL_HOST=mail MAIL_PORT=1025    # Laravel
```

Identical for every stack — no auth, no TLS. See `config-examples.md` for the full table.
