# zdev

**Ever seen a developer and an AI agent fall in love with a dev environment?** 🧑‍💻🤖❤️

zdev is a local development tool that gets you from `git clone` to coding in seconds. One command starts your entire project - HTTPS, routing, shared services, and all. Simple enough for any AI coding agent to operate, powerful enough for complex multi-service setups.

```bash
cd my-project
zdev start
# Your project is running at https://my-project.0ploy.dev
```

> `0ploy.dev` is a wildcard DNS pointing to `127.0.0.1` - everything runs locally on your machine. No cloud, no accounts. You can use your own domain too.

**Requires:** [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (macOS/Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux)

## How It Works

Every project runs in its own isolated network. zdev gives each project its own HTTPS subdomain - no port conflicts, no SSL setup. Shared services like mail catching, database browsing, and Redis inspection are available to all projects automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Your code runs in containers, not on your machine.** Every `pnpm install`, `composer install`, and dev server runs inside an isolated Docker container. If a malicious npm package tries to steal your SSH keys, read your browser cookies, or encrypt your files - it can't. It's trapped in a throwaway container with no access to your host. In an era where supply chain attacks on npm, PyPI, and Packagist are increasingly common, this isn't just convenience - it's protection.

## Built for Coding Agents

zdev gives AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) exactly what they need: deterministic environments with zero ambiguity.

- **One command** - `zdev start` is all the agent needs. No multi-step setup to get wrong.
- **Predictable URLs** - The app is always at `https://{name}.0ploy.dev`. No port guessing.
- **Single config file** - `.zdev/config.yaml` is the complete source of truth. One file to read, not five.
- **Discoverable commands** - `ls .zdev/commands/` reveals all project-specific tasks. No guessing.
- **`zdev exec app <cmd>`** - Run anything in any container. No container name lookup needed.

### Agent Integration

Install the zdev skill so your agent knows how to use the dev environment:

```bash
npx skills add 0ploy/zdev
```

This teaches your agent the full zdev CLI, config format, debugging workflows, and project setup patterns. Your agent can also help you create custom zdev [templates](#templates).

## Why zdev?

| Without zdev | With zdev |
|---------------|------------|
| Port conflicts between projects | Every project gets its own HTTPS subdomain |
| Each project configures its own mail, DB tools | Shared services run once, work for all projects |
| New developer spends a day setting up | Clone, `zdev start`, done |
| Complex Docker Compose with 100+ lines | Simple config with sensible defaults |
| Slow file sync on macOS | Native-speed file sync, zero config |
| Malicious packages can access your entire machine | Code runs in isolated containers - supply chain attacks stay sandboxed |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0ploy/zdev/main/install.sh | sh
```

The installer places the real binary at `~/.zdev/bin/zdev` and symlinks it into `/usr/local/bin` (one-time sudo prompt). After that, zdev keeps itself up to date: a background task on every invocation (at most once per 24h) checks GitHub for a new release and, if found, silently downloads and installs it into the user-owned canonical path - the current command keeps running on the old in-memory binary, the next invocation uses the new one. Set `ZDEV_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable. `zdev self-update` still works for on-demand updates and auto-migrates legacy installs to the symlink layout.

### 2. First-time setup

This installs SSL certificates and starts the shared services (router, mail catcher, DB browser):

```bash
zdev systemcheck
```

### 3. Create a project

The fastest way is to use a template:

```bash
zdev create express my-app
cd my-app
zdev setup
```

Open https://my-app.0ploy.dev - that's it. HTTPS works out of the box.

Or create a project manually with a config file at `my-app/.zdev/config.yaml`:

```yaml
name: my-app

services:
  app:
    image: node:22-alpine
    command: corepack enable && pnpm install && pnpm dev --host 0.0.0.0
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ${PROJECTPATH}:/app
    routing:
      port: 3000

mutagen:
  ignore:
    - node_modules
    - .pnpm-store
    - .nuxt
```

`${PROJECTPATH}` is resolved automatically to your project's absolute path. Other available variables: `${PROJECTNAME}`, `${PROJECTDIR}`, `${ZDEV_DOMAIN}`.

```bash
cd my-app
zdev start
```

## Templates

Create new projects from starter templates with `zdev create`:

```bash
zdev create express my-app            # Express.js
zdev create nuxt4 my-app              # Nuxt 4
zdev create symfony my-app            # Symfony
zdev create myorg/my-template my-app  # Any GitHub repo
```

Browse all available templates on GitHub: [0ploy repositories matching `zdev-template-`](https://github.com/orgs/0ploy/repositories?q=zdev-template-). Each template's README explains what it includes and how to use it.

Want to create your own template? See the [Template Authoring Guide](templates/README.md).

## Shared Services

These run once and are shared across all your projects. No per-project configuration needed.

| Service | URL | What it does |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| Router | `https://router.shared.0ploy.dev` | Routing dashboard - see all routes |
| Mail | `https://mail.shared.0ploy.dev` | Catches all outgoing email ([Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit)) |
| DB | `https://db.shared.0ploy.dev` | Browse any project's database ([Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/)) |
| Redis | `https://redis.shared.0ploy.dev` | Inspect Redis keys and data ([Redis Insights](https://redis.io/insight/)) |
| Logs | `https://logs.shared.0ploy.dev` | Tail container logs across all projects ([Dozzle](https://dozzle.dev/)), grouped per project |

**Connecting from your app containers:** Configure your app to send mail to `mail:1025` (SMTP, no auth). For databases and Redis, use your project's own service names (e.g., `db:5432`, `redis:6379`) - Adminer and Redis Insights are browser UIs, not the services themselves.

**Log retention:** Dozzle is a viewer, not a store. Logs come from Docker's per-container ring buffer (default in Docker Desktop: ~50 MB rotated, ~5 files), so they survive `zdev down` and Docker Desktop restarts but are **lost when a container is recreated** - that includes `zdev update` (on config drift), `zdev remove`, and `zdev services recreate`. To grow the per-container buffer, set `log-opts: { max-size, max-file }` in Docker Desktop's daemon JSON. Persistent log history across recreates needs a separate log shipper (Loki, Vector, etc.) and is out of scope for zdev.

**Per-project visibility:** Dozzle only shows containers from projects that opt in via `shared.logs: true`. Projects without it stay hidden, even though Dozzle has full Docker socket access. Shared service containers (router, mail, db, redis, logs) are always visible.

Open them directly:

```bash
zdev mail        # open Mailpit
zdev db          # open Adminer
zdev redis       # open Redis Insights
zdev logs --open # open Dozzle log viewer
```

**Per-project opt-in/out.** `router`, `mail`, and `logs` are connected to every project by default; `db` and `redis` are opt-in. Override individual fields under `shared:` in `.zdev/config.yaml`; missing fields keep their defaults.

```yaml
# .zdev/config.yaml
shared:
  db: true       # opt in  (default: false)
  redis: true    # opt in  (default: false)
  mail: false    # opt out (default: true)
  # router, logs not listed -> stay at default true
```

## Features

### Automatic HTTPS

Every project and shared service gets locally-trusted HTTPS certificates. Your browser shows a green lock, cookies work with `Secure` flag, and your local environment matches production.

### Fast File Sync (macOS)

File sharing between your host and containers is notoriously slow on macOS. zdev automatically syncs files at native speed - no configuration needed. On Linux this isn't needed (already fast).

How much difference does it make? We benchmarked a Nuxt 4 app with ~1000 dependencies:

| Approach | pnpm install | Cold start to app ready |
|----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Docker bind mount (default macOS) | **34.6s** | ~42s |
| zdev with file sync | **6.7s** | ~17s |
| zdev warm restart (stop + start) | **2.4s** | ~2s |

That's a **5x speedup** on cold start and **instant** warm restarts. The trick: zdev syncs your source code via fast file sync, while keeping `node_modules` and other generated files inside the container where filesystem operations are native speed.

Exclude paths you don't need synced back to the host:

```yaml
mutagen:
  ignore:
    - node_modules
    - .pnpm-store    # pnpm's content-addressable store - platform-specific, don't sync
    - .nuxt
    - .output
    - var/cache
```

**Important:** Always add `.pnpm-store` to the ignore list for pnpm projects. pnpm creates its package store inside the project directory when running in a container. Without ignoring it, ~500MB of platform-specific binaries sync to the host, causing slow syncs and broken native modules when switching images.

### Multi-Service Routing

By default, all HTTP services in a project share the project's domain. For projects with multiple web services (frontend + backend, app + admin), you can assign each service its own domain using `routing.domain`:

```yaml
name: my-app

services:
  frontend:
    image: node:22-alpine
    command: pnpm dev --host 0.0.0.0
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ${PROJECTPATH}/frontend:/app
    routing:
      port: 3000
      # Uses project domain: my-app.0ploy.dev

  backend:
    image: node:22-alpine
    command: pnpm dev --host 0.0.0.0
    working_dir: /app
    volumes:
      - ${PROJECTPATH}/backend:/app
    routing:
      port: 4000
      domain: api.${PROJECTNAME}.${ZDEV_DOMAIN}
      # Uses custom domain: api.my-app.0ploy.dev
```

The `domain` field supports variable substitution and only applies to HTTP/HTTPS routing (not TCP/UDP).

### TCP/UDP Routing

Beyond HTTPS, zdev can expose raw TCP and UDP ports. This lets you connect to a database inside a project from your host using tools like DBeaver, pgAdmin, or `psql`:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    routing:
      protocol: tcp
      port: 5432        # container port
      host_port: 5432   # exposed on localhost:5432
```

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres   # connect from your host
```

Multiple projects can expose different ports without conflicts. Works for MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, or any TCP/UDP service.

### Volumes

**Bind mounts** (`${PROJECTPATH}:/app`) sync your source code into the container. Edits on the host are reflected immediately. On macOS, zdev handles fast sync automatically via Mutagen. Add `node_modules`, `.pnpm-store`, and build caches to `mutagen.ignore` so they stay inside the container (fast) and don't sync back to the host.

**Named volumes** (`db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`) are persistent storage managed by zdev. Use these for data that must survive `zdev down` - database files, uploaded assets, SQLite databases:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ${PROJECTPATH}:/app              # your source code (synced to host)
  - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data  # database files (persists across down)
  - data:/app/data                   # SQLite, uploads, etc.
```

Named volumes persist across `zdev stop`/`zdev start` AND `zdev down`. Only removed with `zdev down -v`. No separate declaration needed - zdev discovers them automatically.

### Custom Commands

Every project has recurring tasks: install deps, run migrations, seed data, run tests. Instead of documenting these in a README, define them as [just](https://github.com/casey/just) files in `.zdev/commands/`. The filename becomes the command:

```
.zdev/commands/
  setup.just     ->  zdev setup
  test.just      ->  zdev test
  seed.just      ->  zdev seed
```

```bash
# .zdev/commands/setup.just
default:
    zdev exec app pnpm ci
    zdev exec app npx prisma db push

# .zdev/commands/test.just
default:
    zdev exec app pnpm test

watch:
    zdev exec app pnpm test -- --watch
```

```bash
zdev setup          # install deps + push schema
zdev test           # run tests
zdev test watch     # run tests in watch mode
```

For CLIs with colon-namespaced subcommands (`cache:clear`, `migrate:fresh`), declare a recipe named after the file - args pass through verbatim:

```just
# .zdev/commands/console.just
console *args:
    zdev exec app php bin/console {{args}}
```

`zdev console cache:clear` -> `bin/console cache:clear`.

Agents can `ls .zdev/commands/` to discover all available project tasks.

### Project Isolation

Each project runs in its own isolated network. Services within a project reach each other by name (`db`, `redis`, `app`), but projects can't see each other's services. The shared router bridges them to the outside.

## Commands

### Lifecycle

```bash
zdev start              # Start every service in the project
zdev start <service>    # Start a single service (project setup runs idempotently)
zdev stop               # Stop containers (keeps them for quick restart)
zdev stop <service>     # Stop a single service container
zdev restart            # Stop + start every service
zdev restart <service>  # Bounce a single service container in-place
zdev down        # Remove containers and network
zdev down -v     # Remove everything including volumes
zdev rename <n>  # Rename project, migrate volumes, restart
```

### Development

```bash
zdev exec app bash              # Shell into a container
zdev exec app pnpm test         # Run a command
zdev logs                       # View logs
zdev logs -f app                # Follow logs for a service
```

### Information

```bash
zdev info        # Show project info, URLs, services
zdev list        # List all projects
zdev config      # Show resolved configuration
zdev status      # Quick status check
zdev open        # Open the current project's URL in the browser
zdev open my-app # Open another registered project's URL
```

### Shared Services

```bash
zdev services status    # Check shared service status
zdev services start     # Start shared services
zdev services stop      # Stop shared services
zdev services recreate  # Rebuild shared service containers
```

### Link Networks

Link networks enable direct container-to-container communication between separate projects. Each project runs on its own isolated Docker network, so by default containers in project A cannot reach containers in project B. Link networks solve this by creating a shared Docker network that selected containers join.

```bash
zdev link create <name>                        # Create a named link network
zdev link join <name> <member> [<member>...]   # Add projects or services
zdev link leave <name> <member> [<member>...]  # Remove members
zdev link delete <name>                        # Remove link and disconnect all
zdev link ls                                   # List all links
zdev link status <name>                        # Show members and connection state
```

Members can be whole projects or individual services:

```bash
zdev link create backend-mesh
zdev link join backend-mesh sec-scan sec-scan-decoder
zdev link join backend-mesh redis-debug.app    # only the app service
```

Linked containers reach each other by their **container name**, not the project domain:

```bash
# From inside sec-scan, reach sec-scan-decoder's app service:
curl http://app.sec-scan-decoder.zdev:3000
```

**Why container names, not project domains?** The project domain (e.g., `sec-scan-decoder.0ploy.dev`) uses wildcard DNS that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. Inside a container, `127.0.0.1` points to the container itself, not the host or Traefik - so the domain is unreachable. Container names (e.g., `app.sec-scan-decoder.zdev`) are resolved by Docker's built-in DNS, which returns the actual container IP on the shared link network. This works reliably and without TLS certificate issues.

The container name pattern is `<service>.<project>.zdev` - the same name shown by `zdev link status`.

Links are stored in the global state file and survive restarts - when a linked project starts, its containers are automatically reconnected to the link network. Each link creates its own Docker network (`zdev_link_<name>`), so different link groups stay isolated from each other.

Link names may only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.

### File Sync (macOS)

```bash
zdev mutagen status  # Check sync status
zdev mutagen flush   # Wait for sync to complete
zdev mutagen reset   # Recreate sync sessions (if stuck)
```

### Project Configuration Reference (`.zdev/config.yaml`)

#### Project-level fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | directory name | Project name, used in domain and container names |
| `domain` | string | `{name}.0ploy.dev` | Project domain for HTTP routing |
| `variables` | map | - | Reusable `${VAR}` placeholders substituted throughout the config (not passed to containers) |
| `environment` | map | - | Environment variables passed to ALL containers |
| `shared.router` | bool | `true` | Connect to shared Traefik router |
| `shared.mail` | bool | `true` | Connect to shared Mailpit |
| `shared.db` | bool | `false` | Connect to shared Adminer |
| `shared.redis` | bool | `false` | Connect to shared Redis Insights |
| `shared.logs` | bool | `true` | Connect to shared Dozzle log viewer |
| `mutagen.ignore` | list | - | Paths excluded from file sync (macOS). Mutagen itself is configured globally, see below |

#### Service fields (`services.<name>.`)

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `image` | string | required | Docker image |
| `command` | string | - | Container command |
| `working_dir` | string | - | Working directory inside container |
| `volumes` | list | - | Volume mounts (bind mounts and named volumes) |
| `environment` | map | - | Env vars for this container (overrides project-level) |
| `routing.protocol` | string | `http` | `http`, `https`, `tcp`, `udp` |
| `routing.port` | int | 80 (http), 443 (https) | Container port to route to |
| `routing.host_port` | int | - | Host port for TCP/UDP (required for tcp/udp) |
| `routing.domain` | string | project domain | Custom domain for this service (http/https only) |
| `labels` | map | - | Docker labels |

#### Variables and environment

**`variables`** define `${VAR}` placeholders substituted throughout the config file. They are NOT passed to containers. Use them to avoid duplicating values like database passwords across services.

**`environment`** (project-level) is passed to ALL containers. **`services.<name>.environment`** is passed to that specific container and overrides project-level values with the same name.

**Built-in variables:** `${PROJECTNAME}`, `${PROJECTPATH}`, `${PROJECTDIR}`, `${ZDEV_DOMAIN}`, `${ZDEV_HOME}`, `${USER}`, `${HOME}`, plus all host environment variables. User-defined `variables` can reference built-in ones (e.g. `DB_NAME: ${PROJECTNAME}_db`).

#### Local overrides (`.zdev/local/config.yaml`)

If `.zdev/local/config.yaml` exists, it is deep-merged on top of `.zdev/config.yaml` before variable substitution. Use it for per-developer settings that shouldn't be committed (secrets, machine-specific tweaks, override images). Add `.zdev/local/` to `.gitignore`.

Merge rules:
- **Maps** merge recursively - e.g. add a single env var to a service without copying the rest.
- **Scalars** in local replace the base value.
- **Slices** in local replace the base slice entirely (no append). To tweak `volumes:` or `mutagen.ignore:`, copy the full list.

Because the merge happens before substitution, you can put `variables:` in the local file and reference them with `${VAR}` from the committed config:

```yaml
# .zdev/config.yaml (committed)
services:
  app:
    environment:
      STRIPE_KEY: ${STRIPE_KEY}

# .zdev/local/config.yaml (gitignored)
variables:
  STRIPE_KEY: sk_test_abc123
```

### Global Configuration Reference (`~/.zdev/global-config.yaml`)

Applies to all projects. Auto-created on first run. Usually you don't need to touch this.

```yaml
domain: 0ploy.dev
ssl:
  enabled: true
mutagen:
  enabled: auto       # "auto" (macOS only), "true" (always), "false" (never)
  sync_mode: two-way-safe  # default sync mode
```

## Troubleshooting

### "DNS doesn't resolve"

`0ploy.dev` uses wildcard DNS pointing to `127.0.0.1`. If it doesn't work:

1. Check: `dig my-app.0ploy.dev`
2. Corporate VPNs sometimes block external DNS - try a different network
3. Add entries to `/etc/hosts` as a workaround

### "Containers won't start"

```bash
zdev down           # clean up
zdev start          # try again
zdev logs -f app    # check what's happening
```

### "File sync is slow" (macOS)

```bash
zdev mutagen status   # check if Mutagen is running
zdev mutagen reset    # recreate sync sessions if stuck
```

### "Port already in use"

zdev uses ports 80 and 443 for the shared router. Check what's using them:

```bash
lsof -i :80
lsof -i :443
```

### Symfony/Sylius/Laravel: stuck "Loading…" debug toolbar, broken admin login, mixed-content errors

Traefik terminates HTTPS and forwards plain HTTP to your app on its internal port. Without a
trusted-proxy config, Symfony (and Laravel) treat the inbound request as HTTP and generate
`http://` URLs inside the HTTPS page - the browser blocks them as mixed content, so the Symfony
debug toolbar hangs on "Loading…" and features that redirect or build absolute URLs (admin login,
password reset emails, asset manifests) break.

Fix - add one env var on the app service:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    environment:
      SYMFONY_TRUSTED_PROXIES: private_ranges    # Symfony/Sylius (RFC1918 + 127.0.0.1)
      # Laravel equivalent:
      # TRUSTED_PROXIES: "*"                      # for the TrustProxies middleware
```

Then apply with `zdev update`. Any framework that generates absolute URLs while running behind
a reverse proxy needs similar awareness.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

zdev doesn't reinvent the wheel. It orchestrates proven open-source tools into a seamless experience - so you get the power without the configuration.
